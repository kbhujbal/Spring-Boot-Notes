Actuator in spring Boot
=========================


=> Actuators are used to monitor and manage our spring boot applications.


=> We can get "Production ready features" by using actuators in our project.


=> With the help of actuators we can get below details


        - Health of app


        - Beans loaded


        - Metrics


        - Loggers


        - URL Mappings


        - Thread Dump


        - Heap Dump




=> To work with actuators we need to add below dependency


<dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>


Note: With above dependency, By default /health endpoint will be exposed.


=> We need to write below property to expose other endpoints


        management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*


=> We can exclude actuator endpoint like below


        management.endpoints.web.exposure.exclude=beans




==============
Endpoint URLS
==============


/health : health of the app  (UP or DOWN)        


/beans : Spring Beans loaded


/configprops : Properties loaded


/mappings : URL patterns of our application


/loggers : Logs of our applications


/threaddump : Threads info


/heapdump  : Heap info


/shutdown : Stop server  (HTTP POST Request)


=============================
What is shutdown endpoint ?
=============================


=> It is used to stop the application.


Note: We need to enable shutdown endpiont in our properties/yml file like below


                management.endpoint.shutdown.enabled=tu


Note: Shutdown endpoint is mapped to POST request. We can send post request using POSTMAN.
